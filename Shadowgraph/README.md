## What is this anyway?

This sample code is a snippet that I developed on top of existing code to automate a segmentation process of ex-vivo lens images. 

Our research lab, the Ophthalmic Biophysics center, developed a device to take photographs of the lens.  Its purpose was to quantify biometry features of the lens (like shape and volume).

My task was to create a user simple interface and optimize the segmentation process.  I wrote most (if not all) of the code in this repo as a showcase of my work.
